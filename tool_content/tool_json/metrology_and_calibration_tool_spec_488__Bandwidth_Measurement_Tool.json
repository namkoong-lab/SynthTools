  "error_messages": [
    "Invalid channel number: Channel must be within supported range for oscilloscope model.",
    "Expected bandwidth invalid: Bandwidth must be a positive number in Hz.",
    "Unsupported probe attenuation: Attenuation must be 1, 10, 100, or 1000.",
    "Insufficient signal generator bandwidth: Signal generator cannot reach frequencies needed for bandwidth test.",
    "Measurement unstable: Cannot achieve stable bandwidth measurement, check connections and probe compensation."
