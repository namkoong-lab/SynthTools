First, please clear your browser cache and cookies, then try the reset process again. Make sure to check your email (including spam folder) for the verification link. When creating your new password, ensure it has at least 8 characters with special symbols. If you continue experiencing issues, I can send a reset link directly to your registered phone number. Would you like me to initiate that for you?",
