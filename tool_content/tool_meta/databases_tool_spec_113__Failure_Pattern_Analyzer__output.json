    "analysis_summary": "Analysis of 5 backup failures reveals storage issues as the primary concern (40% of failures), followed by network connectivity problems. The daily database backup job shows recurring disk space issues, suggesting inadequate capacity planning. Network timeouts and permission errors indicate infrastructure and security configuration gaps that require immediate attention."
