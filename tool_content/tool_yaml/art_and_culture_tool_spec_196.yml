task: Catalog and digitize artwork and artifacts with metadata collection
tool_description: |-
  **STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty**

  This task is **hard**. It involves complex coordination between physical handling, technical digitization, scholarly research, and data standardization. The scope includes multiple specialized subproblems (photography, metadata research, condition assessment, provenance tracking), significant dependencies between workflow steps, high risk of data loss or misattribution, and substantial infrastructure requirements for imaging equipment and storage systems.

  **STEP 2 — Set a tool budget**

  Given the hard difficulty rating, I'm targeting **17 tools** within the 15-20 range to cover the comprehensive workflow from physical object handling through final digital publication.

  **STEP 3 — List all tool names and dependencies**

  1. **Object Registration Tool** - Consumes: basic object info → Produces: unique identifiers, initial records
  2. **Condition Assessment Tool** - Consumes: object details → Produces: condition reports, handling recommendations
  3. **Photography Setup Validator** - Consumes: equipment specs, lighting → Produces: setup verification, calibration status
  4. **Digital Image Capture** - Consumes: camera settings, object info → Produces: raw image files, capture metadata
  5. **Image Quality Analyzer** - Consumes: digital images → Produces: quality metrics, approval status
  6. **Color Profile Manager** - Consumes: images, standards → Produces: color-corrected images, profiles
  7. **Metadata Schema Validator** - Consumes: metadata fields → Produces: validation results, compliance status
  8. **Provenance Research Tool** - Consumes: object history clues → Produces: ownership history, documentation
  9. **Artist Attribution Analyzer** - Consumes: style data, historical records → Produces: attribution assessments
  10. **Dimension Measurement Tool** - Consumes: measurement data → Produces: standardized dimensions, accuracy metrics
  11. **Material Analysis Recorder** - Consumes: analysis results → Produces: material composition, technique data
  12. **Copyright Status Checker** - Consumes: artist info, creation dates → Produces: rights status, restrictions
  13. **Metadata Aggregator Tool** - Consumes: various metadata sources → Produces: consolidated records
  14. **Digital Asset Processor** - Consumes: images, metadata → Produces: processed files, derivatives
  15. **Collection Database Manager** - Consumes: complete records → Produces: database entries, relationships
  16. **Quality Control Auditor** - Consumes: completed records → Produces: audit reports, error identification
  17. **Publication Formatter Tool** - Consumes: approved records → Produces: formatted catalog entries, web-ready data

  **STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans**

  **Simple Plans:**
  1. **Basic Object Entry** (3 tools): Object Registration → Metadata Schema Validator → Collection Database Manager - Accomplishes basic cataloging of straightforward objects
  2. **Quick Image Capture** (3 tools): Photography Setup Validator → Digital Image Capture → Image Quality Analyzer - Handles simple photography documentation

  **Medium Plans:**
  1. **Standard Digitization** (7 tools): Object Registration → Condition Assessment → Photography Setup Validator → Digital Image Capture → Image Quality Analyzer → Color Profile Manager → Digital Asset Processor - Complete basic digitization workflow
  2. **Research-Heavy Cataloging** (6 tools): Provenance Research → Artist Attribution Analyzer → Copyright Status Checker → Metadata Aggregator → Quality Control Auditor → Publication Formatter - Handles objects requiring extensive scholarly research

  **Complex Plans:**
  1. **Full Museum Workflow** (12 tools): Object Registration → Condition Assessment → Photography Setup Validator → Digital Image Capture → Image Quality Analyzer → Color Profile Manager → Provenance Research → Material Analysis Recorder → Metadata Aggregator → Digital Asset Processor → Quality Control Auditor → Collection Database Manager - Comprehensive processing for significant artworks
  2. **Publication-Ready Processing** (10 tools): Dimension Measurement → Artist Attribution Analyzer → Copyright Status Checker → Material Analysis Recorder → Metadata Schema Validator → Metadata Aggregator → Digital Asset Processor → Quality Control Auditor → Collection Database Manager → Publication Formatter - Prepares objects for scholarly publication and exhibition

  **STEP 5 — Produce tools**
