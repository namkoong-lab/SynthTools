task: Automate inventory replenishment and reorder point management
tool_description: |-
  **STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty**

  This task is **hard**. It requires managing complex interdependencies between demand forecasting, supplier relationships, cost optimization, and real-time inventory tracking. The scope involves multiple data sources, financial calculations, and coordination across procurement workflows. Errors can lead to stockouts or excess inventory, both costly. It requires robust data infrastructure and sophisticated analytics.

  **STEP 2 — Set a tool budget**

  Given the hard difficulty rating, I'm targeting **17 tools** within the 15-20 range to handle the comprehensive workflow from demand analysis to automated ordering.

  **STEP 3 — List all tool names with dependencies and affordances**

  1. **Inventory Level Checker** - Consumes: product IDs → Produces: current stock levels, warehouse locations
  2. **Demand Forecaster** - Consumes: historical sales data → Produces: demand predictions, seasonality patterns
  3. **Reorder Point Calculator** - Consumes: demand forecasts, lead times → Produces: optimal reorder points, safety stock levels
  4. **Supplier Lead Time Analyzer** - Consumes: supplier data, historical orders → Produces: lead time estimates, reliability scores
  5. **ABC Analysis Tool** - Consumes: product sales/value data → Produces: product classifications, priority rankings
  6. **Economic Order Quantity Calculator** - Consumes: demand, costs, constraints → Produces: optimal order quantities
  7. **Safety Stock Optimizer** - Consumes: demand variability, service levels → Produces: safety stock recommendations
  8. **Supplier Performance Evaluator** - Consumes: delivery history, quality metrics → Produces: supplier ratings, recommendations
  9. **Purchase Order Generator** - Consumes: reorder decisions, supplier info → Produces: formatted purchase orders
  10. **Cost Analyzer** - Consumes: pricing data, volumes → Produces: total cost calculations, comparisons
  11. **Inventory Turnover Calculator** - Consumes: sales and inventory data → Produces: turnover ratios, efficiency metrics
  12. **Stock Alert Generator** - Consumes: current levels, reorder points → Produces: alerts, priority levels
  13. **Seasonal Adjustment Tool** - Consumes: historical patterns, calendar data → Produces: seasonally adjusted forecasts
  14. **Multi-Supplier Optimizer** - Consumes: supplier capabilities, costs → Produces: optimal supplier allocation
  15. **Inventory Valuation Tool** - Consumes: quantities, unit costs → Produces: inventory values, carrying costs
  16. **Replenishment Scheduler** - Consumes: reorder points, lead times → Produces: optimal timing schedules
  17. **Performance Dashboard Generator** - Consumes: various metrics → Produces: KPI reports, trend analysis

  **STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans**

  **Simple Plans:**
  1. **Basic Stock Check**: Inventory Level Checker → Stock Alert Generator (2 tools) - Monitor current inventory and generate alerts for low stock items
  2. **Quick Reorder**: Reorder Point Calculator → Purchase Order Generator (2 tools) - Calculate when to reorder and generate purchase orders

  **Medium Plans:**
  1. **Demand-Driven Replenishment**: Demand Forecaster → Reorder Point Calculator → Safety Stock Optimizer → Purchase Order Generator (4 tools) - Forecast demand, calculate optimal reorder points with safety stock, and generate orders
  2. **Supplier Performance Analysis**: Supplier Lead Time Analyzer → Supplier Performance Evaluator → Multi-Supplier Optimizer (3 tools) - Analyze supplier reliability and optimize supplier selection
  3. **Inventory Classification**: ABC Analysis Tool → Economic Order Quantity Calculator → Replenishment Scheduler (3 tools) - Classify products by importance and optimize order quantities and timing

  **Complex Plans:**
  1. **Comprehensive Seasonal Replenishment**: Demand Forecaster → Seasonal Adjustment Tool → Reorder Point Calculator → Safety Stock Optimizer → Economic Order Quantity Calculator → Multi-Supplier Optimizer → Purchase Order Generator → Performance Dashboard Generator (8 tools) - Full seasonal demand planning with optimized ordering
  2. **Complete Inventory Optimization**: Inventory Level Checker → ABC Analysis Tool → Demand Forecaster → Supplier Lead Time Analyzer → Cost Analyzer → Economic Order Quantity Calculator → Safety Stock Optimizer → Multi-Supplier Optimizer → Replenishment Scheduler → Purchase Order Generator (10 tools) - End-to-end inventory optimization and automated ordering

  **STEP 5 — Produce tools**
