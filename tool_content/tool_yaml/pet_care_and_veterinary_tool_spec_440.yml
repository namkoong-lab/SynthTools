task: Schedule and manage diagnostic imaging appointments and equipment availability
tool_description: "**STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty**\n\nThis task has medium difficulty. It involves coordinating multiple resources (imaging equipment, veterinary staff, patients), managing complex scheduling constraints, and handling time-sensitive medical needs. The scope includes appointment scheduling, equipment maintenance tracking, and resource optimization, with moderate coordination requirements and potential impact on patient care quality.\n\n**STEP 2 — Set a tool budget**\n\nFor medium difficulty, I'll target 12 tools within the 10-15 range to cover scheduling, equipment management, patient coordination, and reporting workflows comprehensively.\n\n**STEP 3 — List all tool names and dependencies**\n\n1. **Equipment Availability Checker** - Consumes: equipment type, date range; Produces: availability slots\n2. **Staff Schedule Validator** - Consumes: staff IDs, time slots; Produces: staff availability status  \n3. **Appointment Scheduler** - Consumes: patient info, imaging type, preferred times; Produces: scheduled appointment\n4. **Equipment Maintenance Tracker** - Consumes: equipment ID, maintenance type; Produces: maintenance records\n5. **Patient Priority Assessor** - Consumes: patient condition, urgency level; Produces: priority score\n6. **Imaging Protocol Selector** - Consumes: diagnosis, patient details; Produces: recommended protocols\n7. **Appointment Modifier** - Consumes: appointment ID, new parameters; Produces: updated appointment\n8. **Resource Conflict Resolver** - Consumes: conflicting appointments; Produces: resolution options\n9. **Daily Schedule Generator** - Consumes: date, facility; Produces: complete daily schedule\n10. **Equipment Utilization Reporter** - Consumes: time period, equipment; Produces: utilization metrics\n11. **Appointment Reminder Sender** - Consumes: appointment details, contact info; Produces: reminder status\n12. **Emergency Slot Finder** - Consumes: imaging type, timeframe; Produces: emergency availability\n\n**STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans**\n\n**Simple Plans:**\n- Check equipment availability + Schedule routine appointment (2 tools)\n- Generate daily schedule + Send appointment reminders (2 tools)\n\n**Medium Plans:**  \n- Check availability + Validate staff + Assess patient priority + Schedule appointment (4 tools)\n- Track equipment maintenance + Check availability + Resolve conflicts + Modify appointments (4 tools)\n\n**Complex Plans:**\n- Emergency imaging: Assess patient priority + Find emergency slots + Validate staff + Select protocols + Resolve conflicts + Schedule appointment + Send reminders (7 tools)\n- Full facility optimization: Generate daily schedules + Track equipment utilization + Check maintenance + Resolve conflicts + Modify appointments + Send reminders (6 tools)\n\n**STEP 5 — Produce tools**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"Equipment Availability Checker\",\n  \"tool_description\": \"Checks availability of diagnostic imaging equipment within specified date and time ranges, returning available time slots for scheduling appointments.\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"equipment_type\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"description\": \"Type of imaging equipment (X-ray, Ultrasound, CT, MRI, Fluoroscopy)\"\n    },\n    \"start_date\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"description\": \"Start date for availability search\",\n      \"format\": \"date-time\"\n    },\n    \"end_date\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"description\": \"End date for availability search\",\n      \"format\": \"date-time\"\n    },\n    \"duration_minutes\": {\n      \"type\": \"integer\",\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"description\": \"Required appointment duration in minutes (15-180)\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"error_messages\": [\n    \"Invalid equipment type: Use one of [X-ray, Ultrasound, CT, MRI, Fluoroscopy].\",\n    \"Invalid date range: Start date must be before end date and both must be in the future.\",\n    \"Invalid duration: Duration must be between 15 and 180 minutes.\",\n   \
