task: Analyze audience demographics and preferences for venue booking and material selection
tool_description: |-
  **STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty**

  This task involves analyzing complex audience data across multiple venues, understanding demographic patterns, predicting preferences, and making strategic booking decisions. The difficulty is **medium** due to moderate data complexity, some ambiguity in preference prediction, coordination between demographic analysis and material selection, and moderate risk of poor venue/material choices affecting performance success.

  **STEP 2 — Set a tool budget**

  Given the medium difficulty, I'll target **12 tools** within the 10-15 range to cover demographic analysis, preference modeling, venue research, material categorization, and booking coordination.

  **STEP 3 — List all tool names and dependencies**

  Tools and their data flow:
  - **Venue Demographics Analyzer** → demographic profiles
  - **Audience Preference Predictor** → preference scores (consumes demographics)
  - **Comedy Material Categorizer** → categorized content
  - **Performance History Tracker** → historical performance data
  - **Venue Availability Checker** → booking windows
  - **Material Audience Matcher** → match scores (consumes preferences + categories)
  - **Competitor Analysis Tool** → market intelligence
  - **Demographic Trend Analyzer** → trend insights (consumes demographics)
  - **Venue Revenue Calculator** → financial projections
  - **Booking Recommendation Engine** → recommendations (consumes multiple inputs)
  - **Material Selection Optimizer** → optimized setlists
  - **Performance Impact Predictor** → success forecasts

  **STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans**

  **Simple plans:**
  1. Basic venue research: Venue Demographics Analyzer → Venue Availability Checker → Venue Revenue Calculator
  2. Material matching: Comedy Material Categorizer → Material Audience Matcher

  **Medium plans:**
  1. Venue selection: Venue Demographics Analyzer → Audience Preference Predictor → Venue Revenue Calculator → Booking Recommendation Engine
  2. Content optimization: Performance History Tracker → Comedy Material Categorizer → Material Selection Optimizer

  **Complex plans:**
  1. Full market analysis: Venue Demographics Analyzer → Demographic Trend Analyzer → Competitor Analysis Tool → Audience Preference Predictor → Booking Recommendation Engine
  2. Complete performance planning: Comedy Material Categorizer → Material Audience Matcher → Performance History Tracker → Material Selection Optimizer → Performance Impact Predictor

  **STEP 5 — Produce tools**
