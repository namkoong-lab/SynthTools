task: Site survey and feasibility analysis for network infrastructure deployment
tool_description: |-
  **STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty**

  This task has medium-to-high difficulty due to multiple complex subproblems: geographic analysis, RF propagation modeling, regulatory compliance, cost estimation, and technical feasibility assessment. It involves significant coordination between field data collection, regulatory requirements, and engineering analysis, with moderate risk from deployment errors and substantial data/infrastructure requirements for accurate modeling.

  **STEP 2 — Set a tool budget**

  Given the medium-high complexity, I'm targeting 16 tools within the 15-20 range for hard tasks, as this task involves multiple specialized workflows from geographic analysis to regulatory compliance and cost modeling.

  **STEP 3 — List all tool names and dependencies**

  Tools and their data flow:
  1. Geographic Data Collector → provides terrain/demographic data → RF Coverage Predictor, Site Access Analyzer
  2. RF Coverage Predictor → consumes geographic data → Coverage Gap Analyzer, Interference Checker
  3. Site Access Analyzer → consumes location data → Infrastructure Cost Estimator
  4. Regulatory Compliance Checker → provides compliance status → Site Ranking Engine
  5. Soil Composition Analyzer → provides foundation data → Foundation Requirements Calculator
  6. Infrastructure Cost Estimator → consumes site data → ROI Calculator, Site Ranking Engine
  7. Coverage Gap Analyzer → identifies coverage needs → Site Ranking Engine
  8. Interference Checker → validates RF compatibility → Site Ranking Engine
  9. Power Grid Analyzer → assesses power availability → Power Requirements Calculator
  10. Fiber Connectivity Assessor → evaluates backhaul options → Backhaul Cost Estimator
  11. Foundation Requirements Calculator → calculates structural needs → Infrastructure Cost Estimator
  12. Power Requirements Calculator → determines power needs → Infrastructure Cost Estimator
  13. Backhaul Cost Estimator → estimates connectivity costs → ROI Calculator
  14. Environmental Impact Assessor → evaluates environmental factors → Regulatory Compliance Checker
  15. ROI Calculator → performs financial analysis → Site Ranking Engine
  16. Site Ranking Engine → consolidates all inputs → final recommendations

  **STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans**

  Simple plans (3-5 tools):
  - Basic coverage analysis: Geographic Data Collector → RF Coverage Predictor → Coverage Gap Analyzer
  - Quick compliance check: Site Access Analyzer → Regulatory Compliance Checker → Environmental Impact Assessor

  Medium plans (6-10 tools):
  - Site feasibility assessment: Geographic Data Collector → Site Access Analyzer → Soil Composition Analyzer → Foundation Requirements Calculator → Infrastructure Cost Estimator → ROI Calculator
  - RF planning workflow: Geographic Data Collector → RF Coverage Predictor → Coverage Gap Analyzer → Interference Checker → Site Ranking Engine

  Complex plans (11+ tools):
  - Complete site survey: Geographic Data Collector → RF Coverage Predictor → Site Access Analyzer → Regulatory Compliance Checker → Soil Composition Analyzer → Foundation Requirements Calculator → Power Grid Analyzer → Power Requirements Calculator → Infrastructure Cost Estimator → ROI Calculator → Site Ranking Engine
  - Full infrastructure analysis: All 16 tools in dependency order for comprehensive deployment planning

  **STEP 5 — Produce tools**
