task: Evaluate supplier financial health and business stability through credit reports and financial analysis
tool_description: |-
  **STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty**

  This task is **hard** due to its broad scope requiring financial statement analysis, credit scoring, and risk assessment across multiple dimensions. It involves significant ambiguity in interpreting financial ratios and qualitative factors, requires coordination between financial data sources and analytical models, carries high risk as poor supplier stability can disrupt operations, and demands substantial financial data infrastructure and analytical capabilities.

  **STEP 2 — Set a tool budget**

  Given the hard difficulty rating, I'm targeting **17 tools** within the 15-20 range to handle the comprehensive financial analysis, credit evaluation, and risk assessment workflows required for thorough supplier evaluation.

  **STEP 3 — List all tool names with dependencies and affordances**

  1. **Financial Data Extractor** - Consumes: supplier identifiers → Produces: raw financial statements
  2. **Credit Report Retriever** - Consumes: supplier identifiers → Produces: credit bureau data
  3. **Financial Ratio Calculator** - Consumes: financial statements → Produces: liquidity/profitability ratios
  4. **Liquidity Analyzer** - Consumes: balance sheet data → Produces: liquidity assessment
  5. **Profitability Evaluator** - Consumes: income statement data → Produces: profitability metrics
  6. **Debt Coverage Assessor** - Consumes: financial statements → Produces: debt service capabilities
  7. **Cash Flow Analyzer** - Consumes: cash flow statements → Produces: cash flow health metrics
  8. **Credit Score Interpreter** - Consumes: credit reports → Produces: credit risk assessment
  9. **Industry Benchmark Comparator** - Consumes: financial metrics + industry data → Produces: relative performance
  10. **Trend Analysis Engine** - Consumes: multi-period financial data → Produces: trend indicators
  11. **Working Capital Evaluator** - Consumes: current assets/liabilities → Produces: working capital health
  12. **Business Continuity Assessor** - Consumes: various financial metrics → Produces: stability score
  13. **Risk Factor Identifier** - Consumes: comprehensive financial data → Produces: risk factors list
  14. **Financial Health Scorer** - Consumes: all financial metrics → Produces: composite health score
  15. **Supplier Rating Generator** - Consumes: all assessments → Produces: overall supplier rating
  16. **Alert System Configurator** - Consumes: risk thresholds → Produces: monitoring alerts
  17. **Assessment Report Compiler** - Consumes: all analyses → Produces: comprehensive evaluation report

  **STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans**

  **Simple Plans:**
  - **Basic Credit Check**: Credit Report Retriever → Credit Score Interpreter → Supplier Rating Generator
  - **Quick Liquidity Check**: Financial Data Extractor → Liquidity Analyzer → Assessment Report Compiler

  **Medium Plans:**
  - **Standard Financial Health**: Financial Data Extractor → Financial Ratio Calculator → Profitability Evaluator → Liquidity Analyzer → Financial Health Scorer → Assessment Report Compiler
  - **Comparative Analysis**: Financial Data Extractor → Financial Ratio Calculator → Industry Benchmark Comparator → Trend Analysis Engine → Supplier Rating Generator

  **Complex Plans:**
  - **Comprehensive Supplier Evaluation**: Financial Data Extractor → Credit Report Retriever → Financial Ratio Calculator → Liquidity Analyzer → Profitability Evaluator → Debt Coverage Assessor → Cash Flow Analyzer → Credit Score Interpreter → Industry Benchmark Comparator → Trend Analysis Engine → Working Capital Evaluator → Business Continuity Assessor → Risk Factor Identifier → Financial Health Scorer → Supplier Rating Generator → Alert System Configurator → Assessment Report Compiler
  - **Multi-Period Risk Assessment**: Financial Data Extractor → Trend Analysis Engine → Cash Flow Analyzer → Debt Coverage Assessor → Working Capital Evaluator → Risk Factor Identifier → Business Continuity Assessor → Financial Health Scorer → Alert System Configurator

  **STEP 5 — Produce tools**
