task: Client consultation and booking management for portrait sessions
tool_description: |-
  ## STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty

  This task involves moderate complexity with multiple interconnected workflows including client communication, scheduling coordination, service customization, and business process management. The scope covers consultation processes, booking logistics, pricing structures, and client relationship management with dependencies between scheduling, pricing, and service delivery coordination. **Difficulty: Medium**

  ## STEP 2 — Set a tool budget

  Given the medium complexity involving client management, scheduling, pricing, service configuration, and consultation workflows, I'll target **12 tools** to cover the comprehensive booking and consultation process.

  ## STEP 3 — List all tool names and dependencies

  **Tools and their data flow:**
  1. **Client Profile Creator** → produces client records for other tools
  2. **Session Availability Checker** → consumes date ranges, produces available slots
  3. **Service Package Builder** → produces customized service offerings
  4. **Quote Generator** → consumes service packages, produces pricing estimates
  5. **Consultation Scheduler** → consumes availability data, produces scheduled appointments
  6. **Client Questionnaire Processor** → produces structured client preferences
  7. **Location Validator** → consumes location data, produces venue confirmations
  8. **Contract Generator** → consumes booking details, produces legal agreements
  9. **Payment Tracker** → consumes financial data, produces payment status
  10. **Session Reminder System** → consumes booking data, produces notification schedules
  11. **Booking Status Manager** → consumes/produces booking state changes
  12. **Client Communication Logger** → produces communication history records

  ## STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans

  **Simple Plans:**
  - **Basic Inquiry Response**: Client Profile Creator → Service Package Builder → Quote Generator
  - **Quick Availability Check**: Session Availability Checker → Consultation Scheduler

  **Medium Plans:**
  - **Full Consultation Workflow**: Client Profile Creator → Client Questionnaire Processor → Service Package Builder → Quote Generator → Location Validator → Consultation Scheduler
  - **Booking Confirmation Process**: Contract Generator → Payment Tracker → Booking Status Manager → Session Reminder System

  **Complex Plans:**
  - **Complete Client Onboarding**: Client Profile Creator → Client Questionnaire Processor → Session Availability Checker → Service Package Builder → Quote Generator → Location Validator → Consultation Scheduler → Contract Generator → Payment Tracker → Booking Status Manager → Client Communication Logger
  - **Full Service Management**: All tools working together to manage multiple clients through complete booking lifecycle from initial inquiry to session completion

  ## STEP 5 — Produce tools
