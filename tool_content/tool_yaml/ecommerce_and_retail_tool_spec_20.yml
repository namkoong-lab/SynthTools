task: Pricing Strategy Implementation and Dynamic Adjustments
tool_description: |-
  **STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty**

  This task involves medium complexity due to the need to coordinate multiple pricing factors (competitor analysis, inventory levels, demand patterns, market conditions), manage dependencies between pricing rules and business constraints, and handle the risk of pricing errors that could significantly impact revenue and competitiveness.

  **STEP 2 — Set a tool budget**

  Given the medium complexity, I'll target 12 tools to cover the various aspects of pricing strategy implementation including market analysis, rule management, price calculation, validation, and monitoring.

  **STEP 3 — List all tool names and dependencies**

  1. **Market Data Collector** - Consumes: competitor URLs, product identifiers → Produces: competitor pricing data
  2. **Price Rule Engine** - Consumes: business rules, constraints → Produces: pricing logic configuration
  3. **Demand Forecaster** - Consumes: historical sales data, seasonality factors → Produces: demand predictions
  4. **Inventory Analyzer** - Consumes: stock levels, turnover rates → Produces: inventory insights
  5. **Price Calculator** - Consumes: cost data, rules, market conditions → Produces: calculated prices
  6. **Margin Validator** - Consumes: calculated prices, cost data → Produces: margin analysis
  7. **Price Change Simulator** - Consumes: proposed prices, historical data → Produces: impact projections
  8. **Competitive Position Analyzer** - Consumes: own prices, competitor prices → Produces: positioning insights
  9. **Price History Tracker** - Consumes: pricing changes, timestamps → Produces: historical price trends
  10. **Dynamic Adjustment Engine** - Consumes: triggers, current prices, rules → Produces: price updates
  11. **Price Performance Monitor** - Consumes: sales data, price changes → Produces: performance metrics
  12. **Price Alert System** - Consumes: thresholds, current metrics → Produces: alert notifications

  **STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans**

  **Simple Plans:**
  - Basic pricing update: Market Data Collector → Price Calculator → Margin Validator
  - Inventory-based adjustment: Inventory Analyzer → Dynamic Adjustment Engine → Price Performance Monitor

  **Medium Plans:**
  - Competitive pricing strategy: Market Data Collector → Competitive Position Analyzer → Price Rule Engine → Price Calculator → Price Change Simulator
  - Demand-driven pricing: Demand Forecaster → Inventory Analyzer → Price Calculator → Margin Validator → Dynamic Adjustment Engine

  **Complex Plans:**
  - Full dynamic pricing implementation: Market Data Collector → Demand Forecaster → Inventory Analyzer → Price Rule Engine → Price Calculator → Price Change Simulator → Margin Validator → Dynamic Adjustment Engine → Price Performance Monitor → Price Alert System
  - Strategic pricing review: Price History Tracker → Market Data Collector → Competitive Position Analyzer → Demand Forecaster → Price Rule Engine → Price Calculator → Price Change Simulator

  **STEP 5 — Produce tools**
