task: Policy verification and coverage determination
tool_description: "## STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty\n\nThis task involves medium complexity due to the need to cross-reference policy documents, interpret coverage terms, validate claim eligibility, and handle multiple interdependent verification steps. The task requires coordination between document analysis, rule-based verification, and regulatory compliance checks, with moderate risk of errors that could lead to incorrect coverage decisions.\n\n## STEP 2 — Set a tool budget\n\nGiven the medium complexity, I'll target 12 tools to cover the comprehensive workflow of policy verification and coverage determination, from initial document retrieval through final coverage analysis.\n\n## STEP 3 — List all tool names and dependencies\n\n1. **Policy Document Retriever** - Consumes: policy number, claimant info → Produces: policy documents, metadata\n2. **Policy Status Validator** - Consumes: policy data → Produces: validity status, active periods  \n3. **Coverage Parser** - Consumes: policy documents → Produces: structured coverage details, limits\n4. **Premium Payment Checker** - Consumes: policy number, claim date → Produces: payment status, gaps\n5. **Deductible Calculator** - Consumes: coverage details, claim amount → Produces: applicable deductibles\n6. **Exclusion Analyzer** - Consumes: policy terms, claim details → Produces: exclusion applicability\n7. **Coverage Limit Evaluator** - Consumes: policy limits, claim amount → Produces: coverage adequacy\n8. **Policy Amendment Tracker** - Consumes: policy number, date range → Produces: amendments, endorsements\n9. **Regulatory Compliance Checker** - Consumes: policy details, jurisdiction → Produces: compliance status\n10. **Risk Assessment Validator** - Consumes: policy data, claim type → Produces: risk category validation\n11. **Coverage Gap Identifier** - Consumes: multiple coverage sources → Produces: gap analysis\n12. **Final Coverage Determiner** - Consumes: all verification results → Produces: final coverage decision\n\n## STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans\n\n**Simple Plans:**\n1. Basic Policy Check: Policy Document Retriever → Policy Status Validator → Coverage Parser (verify basic policy validity and coverage)\n2. Payment Verification: Policy Document Retriever → Premium Payment Checker → Policy Status Validator (confirm policy is current and paid)\n\n**Medium Plans:**\n1. Standard Coverage Analysis: Policy Document Retriever → Coverage Parser → Deductible Calculator → Coverage Limit Evaluator → Final Coverage Determiner (comprehensive coverage assessment)\n2. Amendment Review: Policy Document Retriever → Policy Amendment Tracker → Coverage Parser → Exclusion Analyzer (analyze policy with modifications)\n\n**Complex Plans:**\n1. Full Verification Workflow: Policy Document Retriever → Policy Status Validator → Premium Payment Checker → Coverage Parser → Policy Amendment Tracker → Exclusion Analyzer → Coverage Limit Evaluator → Regulatory Compliance Checker → Final Coverage Determiner (complete end-to-end verification)\n2. Multi-Source Analysis: Policy Document Retriever → Coverage Parser → Coverage Gap Identifier → Risk Assessment Validator → Regulatory Compliance Checker → Final Coverage Determiner (comprehensive multi-policy analysis)\n\n## STEP 5 — Produce tools\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"Policy Document Retriever\",\n  \"tool_description\": \"Retrieves policy documents and metadata from insurance database using policy number and claimant information.\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"policy_number\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"description\": \"The insurance policy number to retrieve\"\n    },\n    \"claimant_name\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"description\": \"Full name of the claimant\"\n    },\n    \"retrieval_date\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"description\": \"Date for document retrieval context\",\n      \"format\": \"date-time\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"error_messages\": [\n    \"Policy not found: The policy number does not exist in the database.
