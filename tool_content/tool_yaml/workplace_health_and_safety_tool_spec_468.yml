task: Report and document workplace incidents with detailed incident information
tool_description: |-
  **STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty**

  This task involves systematic documentation of workplace incidents, requiring detailed information collection, compliance with regulatory standards, proper categorization, and coordination between multiple stakeholders. The task has medium complexity due to the need for structured data capture, regulatory compliance, and potential legal implications of accurate documentation.

  **STEP 2 — Set a tool budget**

  Given the medium complexity, I'll target 12 tools to cover incident intake, documentation, classification, witness management, evidence collection, notification workflows, and compliance reporting.

  **STEP 3 — List all tool names with dependencies and affordances**

  1. **Incident Report Creator** - Consumes: basic incident details → Produces: incident record with unique ID
  2. **Incident Classifier** - Consumes: incident description → Produces: categorized incident type and severity
  3. **Witness Information Collector** - Consumes: witness details → Produces: structured witness records
  4. **Evidence Attachment Manager** - Consumes: file paths and metadata → Produces: organized evidence inventory
  5. **Injury Assessment Recorder** - Consumes: injury details → Produces: medical documentation record
  6. **Timeline Constructor** - Consumes: event sequence data → Produces: chronological incident timeline
  7. **Stakeholder Notifier** - Consumes: incident data and contact lists → Produces: notification confirmations
  8. **Regulatory Compliance Checker** - Consumes: incident details → Produces: compliance requirements checklist
  9. **Risk Factor Analyzer** - Consumes: incident circumstances → Produces: identified risk factors
  10. **Location Mapper** - Consumes: incident location data → Produces: detailed location record
  11. **Report Generator** - Consumes: all incident data → Produces: formatted incident report
  12. **Incident Status Tracker** - Consumes: status updates → Produces: investigation progress record

  **STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans**

  **Simple plans:**
  - Basic incident logging: Incident Report Creator → Incident Classifier → Location Mapper
  - Witness documentation: Witness Information Collector → Evidence Attachment Manager → Report Generator

  **Medium plans:**
  - Complete incident intake: Incident Report Creator → Incident Classifier → Location Mapper → Timeline Constructor → Witness Information Collector → Report Generator
  - Injury incident workflow: Incident Report Creator → Injury Assessment Recorder → Risk Factor Analyzer → Regulatory Compliance Checker → Stakeholder Notifier

  **Complex plans:**
  - Full investigation documentation: All 12 tools in sequence for comprehensive incident reporting
  - Multi-stakeholder incident management: Incident Report Creator → Incident Classifier → Witness Information Collector → Evidence Attachment Manager → Stakeholder Notifier → Regulatory Compliance Checker → Risk Factor Analyzer → Report Generator → Incident Status Tracker

  **STEP 5 — Produce tools**
