  **STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty**

  This task involves moderate complexity due to the need for comprehensive financial analysis, risk assessment across multiple dimensions, regulatory compliance considerations, and integration of various data sources. The task requires careful coordination between credit evaluation, limit setting, monitoring, and reporting components, with significant impact potential for business cash flow and customer relationships. **Medium difficulty.**

  **STEP 2 — Set a tool budget**

  Given the medium complexity, I'm targeting **12 tools** to cover the complete workflow from initial credit assessment through ongoing monitoring and reporting.

  **STEP 3 — List all tool names and dependencies**

  1. **Customer Financial Data Collector** - Consumes: customer identifiers → Produces: financial statements, payment history
  2. **Credit Score Calculator** - Consumes: financial data, payment history → Produces: credit scores, risk ratings
  3. **Industry Risk Analyzer** - Consumes: industry codes, economic indicators → Produces: industry risk assessments
  4. **Credit Limit Recommender** - Consumes: credit scores, financial data, risk assessments → Produces: recommended credit limits
  5. **Credit Application Processor** - Consumes: application data, supporting documents → Produces: processed application records
  6. **Payment History Analyzer** - Consumes: transaction records, payment dates → Produces: payment behavior metrics
  7. **Financial Ratio Calculator** - Consumes: financial statements → Produces: key financial ratios
  8. **Collateral Evaluator** - Consumes: asset information, market data → Produces: collateral valuations
  9. **Credit Policy Validator** - Consumes: credit decisions, policy rules → Produces: compliance status
  10. **Credit Limit Monitor** - Consumes: current balances, credit limits → Produces: utilization alerts
  11. **Risk Report Generator** - Consumes: all assessment data → Produces: comprehensive risk reports
  12. **Credit Decision Tracker** - Consumes: decisions, outcomes, changes → Produces: audit trails

  **STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans**

  **Simple Plans:**
  - Basic Credit Check: Customer Financial Data Collector → Credit Score Calculator → Credit Limit Recommender
  - Payment Analysis: Payment History Analyzer → Financial Ratio Calculator → Risk Report Generator

  **Medium Plans:**
  - New Customer Assessment: Credit Application Processor → Customer Financial Data Collector → Credit Score Calculator → Industry Risk Analyzer → Credit Limit Recommender → Credit Policy Validator
  - Existing Customer Review: Payment History Analyzer → Financial Ratio Calculator → Credit Score Calculator → Credit Limit Monitor → Credit Decision Tracker

  **Complex Plans:**
  - Comprehensive Credit Assessment: Credit Application Processor → Customer Financial Data Collector → Payment History Analyzer → Financial Ratio Calculator → Industry Risk Analyzer → Collateral Evaluator → Credit Score Calculator → Credit Limit Recommender → Credit Policy Validator → Credit Decision Tracker
  - Full Portfolio Review: Customer Financial Data Collector → Payment History Analyzer → Financial Ratio Calculator → Credit Score Calculator → Credit Limit Monitor → Industry Risk Analyzer → Risk Report Generator → Credit Policy Validator

  **STEP 5 — Produce tools**
