task: Portrait session planning and location scouting
tool_description: |-
  **STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty**

  This task involves moderate complexity with multiple interdependent components including client communication, location research, technical planning, and logistical coordination. The task requires balancing creative vision with practical constraints like weather, permits, and equipment needs, making it a medium difficulty task.

  **STEP 2 — Set a tool budget**

  Given the medium difficulty, I'll target 12 tools to cover the various aspects of portrait session planning and location scouting comprehensively.

  **STEP 3 — List all tool names and dependencies**

  Tools and their flow:
  - Client Requirements Collector → produces client preferences, consumed by Location Scout and Session Planner
  - Location Scout → produces location options, consumed by Location Evaluator and Permit Checker
  - Location Evaluator → produces scored locations, consumed by Final Location Selector
  - Weather Forecast Analyzer → produces weather data, consumed by Session Scheduler and Backup Plan Generator
  - Equipment Requirements Calculator → produces equipment lists, consumed by Equipment Availability Checker
  - Equipment Availability Checker → produces equipment status, consumed by Session Planner
  - Permit Checker → produces permit requirements, consumed by Session Planner
  - Session Scheduler → produces time slots, consumed by Session Planner
  - Lighting Condition Analyzer → produces lighting data, consumed by Session Planner
  - Final Location Selector → produces chosen location, consumed by Session Planner
  - Backup Plan Generator → produces contingency plans, consumed by Session Summary Generator
  - Session Summary Generator → produces final session plan

  **STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans**

  Simple plans:
  1. Basic indoor session: Client Requirements Collector → Equipment Requirements Calculator → Session Scheduler → Session Summary Generator
  2. Quick outdoor portrait: Location Scout → Weather Forecast Analyzer → Session Scheduler → Session Summary Generator

  Medium plans:
  1. Standard outdoor session: Client Requirements Collector → Location Scout → Location Evaluator → Weather Forecast Analyzer → Equipment Requirements Calculator → Session Scheduler → Session Summary Generator
  2. Professional headshots: Client Requirements Collector → Location Scout → Lighting Condition Analyzer → Equipment Requirements Calculator → Equipment Availability Checker → Session Summary Generator

  Complex plans:
  1. Full commercial portrait session: All tools in sequence for comprehensive planning including permits, multiple locations, and detailed backup plans
  2. Multi-location fashion shoot: Client Requirements Collector → Location Scout → Location Evaluator → Permit Checker → Weather Forecast Analyzer → Equipment Requirements Calculator → Equipment Availability Checker → Lighting Condition Analyzer → Session Scheduler → Final Location Selector → Backup Plan Generator → Session Summary Generator

  **STEP 5 — Produce tools**
