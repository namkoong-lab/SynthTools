  **STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty**

  This task involves medium complexity due to the need to track multiple interconnected academic requirements (prerequisites, co-requisites, credit hours, GPA thresholds), handle diverse degree program structures, validate course sequences, and manage exceptions or substitutions. The coordination between different academic policies and real-time student progress tracking adds moderate complexity.

  **STEP 2 — Set a tool budget**

  Given the medium difficulty, I'll target 12 tools to cover the various sub-workflows: course validation, prerequisite checking, credit tracking, GPA calculation, requirement mapping, progress assessment, and exception handling.

  **STEP 3 — List all tool names and dependencies**

  1. **Course Catalog Validator** - Consumes: course codes, term → Produces: course details, validity status
  2. **Prerequisite Checker** - Consumes: course codes, transcript data → Produces: prerequisite compliance
  3. **Credit Hour Calculator** - Consumes: completed courses, grades → Produces: credit totals, GPA metrics
  4. **Degree Program Mapper** - Consumes: program code, catalog year → Produces: requirement structure
  5. **Course Sequence Planner** - Consumes: degree requirements, completed courses → Produces: remaining course plan
  6. **GPA Threshold Validator** - Consumes: grades, requirements → Produces: GPA compliance status
  7. **Transfer Credit Evaluator** - Consumes: external transcripts, equivalency rules → Produces: applicable credits
  8. **Graduation Requirement Auditor** - Consumes: all academic data → Produces: comprehensive graduation status
  9. **Course Substitution Processor** - Consumes: substitution requests, approval data → Produces: approved alternatives
  10. **Academic Standing Calculator** - Consumes: GPA, credit progress → Produces: standing status
  11. **Requirement Exception Handler** - Consumes: exception requests, policies → Produces: approved exceptions
  12. **Progress Timeline Generator** - Consumes: current status, planned courses → Produces: graduation timeline

  **STEP 4 — List multi-tool plans**

  **Simple Plans:**
  - Basic Progress Check: Course Catalog Validator → Credit Hour Calculator → Academic Standing Calculator
  - Quick Prerequisite Validation: Course Catalog Validator → Prerequisite Checker

  **Medium Plans:**
  - Degree Audit: Degree Program Mapper → Credit Hour Calculator → GPA Threshold Validator → Graduation Requirement Auditor
  - Transfer Student Evaluation: Transfer Credit Evaluator → Degree Program Mapper → Course Sequence Planner

  **Complex Plans:**
  - Comprehensive Graduation Planning: Degree Program Mapper → Credit Hour Calculator → Transfer Credit Evaluator → Course Substitution Processor → Prerequisite Checker → Course Sequence Planner → Progress Timeline Generator
  - Full Academic Review: All tools integrated for complete student academic status assessment and planning

  **STEP 5 — Produce tools**
