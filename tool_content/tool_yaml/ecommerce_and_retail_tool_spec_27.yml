subfield: Inventory Management and Tracking
task: Automated reorder point calculation and purchase order generation
tool_description: |-
  **STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty**

  This task has medium complexity due to multiple interdependent calculations (demand forecasting, lead time analysis, safety stock optimization), coordination between inventory tracking and supplier management systems, and moderate risk from stockouts or overstock situations that can significantly impact business operations.

  **STEP 2 — Set a tool budget**

  Given the medium difficulty, I'll target 12 tools to cover the workflow from data collection through purchase order generation and monitoring.

  **STEP 3 — List all tool names and dependencies**

  1. **Inventory Data Collector** - Consumes: product IDs, date ranges → Produces: current stock levels, historical inventory data
  2. **Sales History Analyzer** - Consumes: product IDs, time periods → Produces: sales patterns, seasonal trends
  3. **Demand Forecaster** - Consumes: historical sales data, seasonality factors → Produces: predicted demand quantities
  4. **Lead Time Calculator** - Consumes: supplier data, product categories → Produces: average lead times, variability metrics
  5. **Safety Stock Optimizer** - Consumes: demand forecasts, lead times, service levels → Produces: optimal safety stock levels
  6. **Reorder Point Calculator** - Consumes: demand forecasts, lead times, safety stock → Produces: reorder trigger points
  7. **Supplier Evaluator** - Consumes: supplier performance data → Produces: supplier rankings, reliability scores
  8. **Order Quantity Optimizer** - Consumes: demand data, carrying costs, ordering costs → Produces: economic order quantities
  9. **Purchase Order Generator** - Consumes: reorder triggers, supplier info, quantities → Produces: formatted purchase orders
  10. **Cost Analyzer** - Consumes: product costs, supplier pricing → Produces: cost comparisons, budget impacts
  11. **Stock Level Monitor** - Consumes: current inventory, reorder points → Produces: reorder alerts, status reports
  12. **Performance Tracker** - Consumes: order history, fulfillment data → Produces: KPI metrics, performance reports

  **STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans**

  **Simple Plans:**
  1. **Basic Stock Check**: Stock Level Monitor → Reorder Point Calculator → Purchase Order Generator (monitors current levels and generates orders when needed)
  2. **Supplier Comparison**: Supplier Evaluator → Cost Analyzer (evaluates and compares supplier options for procurement decisions)

  **Medium Plans:**
  1. **Seasonal Reorder Planning**: Sales History Analyzer → Demand Forecaster → Safety Stock Optimizer → Reorder Point Calculator (accounts for seasonal demand in reorder calculations)
  2. **Complete Order Optimization**: Lead Time Calculator → Order Quantity Optimizer → Cost Analyzer → Purchase Order Generator (optimizes order timing and quantities while considering costs)

  **Complex Plans:**
  1. **Full Automated Reordering**: Inventory Data Collector → Sales History Analyzer → Demand Forecaster → Lead Time Calculator → Safety Stock Optimizer → Reorder Point Calculator → Stock Level Monitor → Purchase Order Generator (end-to-end automated reordering system)
  2. **Performance-Driven Procurement**: Supplier Evaluator → Lead Time Calculator → Cost Analyzer → Order Quantity Optimizer → Purchase Order Generator → Performance Tracker (optimizes procurement based on supplier performance and tracks results)

  **STEP 5 — Produce tools**
