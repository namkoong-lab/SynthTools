task: Resume and cover letter optimization for specific job applications
tool_description: |-
  STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty

  The task of resume and cover letter optimization for specific job applications is **medium** difficulty. It requires analyzing job requirements, tailoring multiple document sections, understanding industry-specific language, and ensuring strategic alignment between applicant skills and employer needs, but the scope is well-defined with established best practices.

  STEP 2 — Set a tool budget

  Given the medium complexity, I'll target **12 tools** within the 10-15 range. This allows for comprehensive coverage of resume analysis, content optimization, formatting, keyword matching, and cover letter customization without over-engineering the solution.

  STEP 3 — List all tool names and dependencies

  1. **Job Description Parser** - Consumes: job posting text → Produces: structured job requirements
  2. **Resume Content Analyzer** - Consumes: resume text → Produces: content analysis and gaps
  3. **Keyword Matcher** - Consumes: job requirements, resume content → Produces: keyword alignment scores
  4. **Skills Gap Identifier** - Consumes: job requirements, applicant skills → Produces: missing skills analysis
  5. **Experience Quantifier** - Consumes: experience descriptions → Produces: enhanced quantified descriptions
  6. **ATS Compatibility Checker** - Consumes: resume format/content → Produces: ATS optimization recommendations
  7. **Resume Section Optimizer** - Consumes: resume sections, job requirements → Produces: optimized section content
  8. **Cover Letter Generator** - Consumes: job details, applicant info → Produces: customized cover letter draft
  9. **Industry Language Adapter** - Consumes: content, industry type → Produces: industry-appropriate language
  10. **Document Formatter** - Consumes: content, format preferences → Produces: professionally formatted document
  11. **Content Relevance Scorer** - Consumes: resume/cover letter, job description → Produces: relevance assessment
  12. **Final Review Validator** - Consumes: optimized documents → Produces: comprehensive quality check

  STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans

  **Simple Plans:**
  1. Job Description Parser → Resume Content Analyzer → Document Formatter (Basic resume cleanup)
  2. Experience Quantifier → ATS Compatibility Checker → Final Review Validator (Experience enhancement and validation)

  **Medium Plans:**
  1. Job Description Parser → Skills Gap Identifier → Resume Section Optimizer → Cover Letter Generator (Targeted application package)
  2. Resume Content Analyzer → Keyword Matcher → Industry Language Adapter → Content Relevance Scorer (Strategic content optimization)

  **Complex Plans:**
  1. Job Description Parser → Resume Content Analyzer → Skills Gap Identifier → Keyword Matcher → Resume Section Optimizer → ATS Compatibility Checker → Document Formatter → Final Review Validator (Complete resume overhaul)
  2. Job Description Parser → Resume Content Analyzer → Experience Quantifier → Industry Language Adapter → Cover Letter Generator → Content Relevance Scorer → Final Review Validator (Full application package optimization)
