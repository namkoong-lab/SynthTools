subfield: Labor Relations and Union Negotiations
task: Labor cost modeling and budget impact assessment
tool_description: |-
  ## STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty

  This task is **hard** due to its broad scope involving complex financial modeling, legal compliance requirements, multi-stakeholder coordination between unions and management, high-stakes decision impact on organizational budgets, and extensive data requirements spanning compensation, benefits, regulatory, and operational metrics.

  ## STEP 2 — Set a tool budget

  Given the hard difficulty rating, I'm targeting **17 tools** within the 15-20 range to handle the comprehensive workflow from data collection through scenario modeling to impact assessment and reporting.

  ## STEP 3 — List all tool names and dependencies

  **Tools and Flow:**
  1. **Compensation Data Extractor** → produces wage/salary data
  2. **Benefits Cost Calculator** → consumes employee data, produces benefit costs
  3. **Union Contract Parser** → produces contract terms and constraints
  4. **Regulatory Compliance Checker** → consumes contract terms, produces compliance status
  5. **Historical Cost Analyzer** → consumes financial data, produces trend analysis
  6. **Workforce Demographics Analyzer** → produces demographic breakdowns
  7. **Scenario Parameter Builder** → consumes various inputs, produces scenario configurations
  8. **Labor Cost Projector** → consumes scenarios and base data, produces cost projections
  9. **Budget Impact Calculator** → consumes projections, produces budget impacts
  10. **Sensitivity Analysis Runner** → consumes models, produces sensitivity results
  11. **Contract Term Evaluator** → consumes proposals, produces term assessments
  12. **Negotiation Position Scorer** → consumes multiple data sources, produces position strength
  13. **Risk Assessment Generator** → consumes scenarios, produces risk profiles
  14. **Comparative Market Analyzer** → produces market benchmarks
  15. **Financial Constraint Validator** → consumes budgets, produces validation results
  16. **Report Generator** → consumes analysis results, produces formatted reports
  17. **Dashboard Metrics Builder** → consumes all data, produces dashboard metrics

  ## STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans

  **Simple Plans:**
  - *Basic Cost Analysis*: Compensation Data Extractor → Benefits Cost Calculator → Budget Impact Calculator → Report Generator
  - *Compliance Check*: Union Contract Parser → Regulatory Compliance Checker → Report Generator

  **Medium Plans:**
  - *Market Position Assessment*: Comparative Market Analyzer → Compensation Data Extractor → Negotiation Position Scorer → Risk Assessment Generator → Report Generator
  - *Historical Trend Analysis*: Historical Cost Analyzer → Workforce Demographics Analyzer → Labor Cost Projector → Dashboard Metrics Builder

  **Complex Plans:**
  - *Full Negotiation Preparation*: All demographic and cost tools → Scenario Parameter Builder → Labor Cost Projector → Sensitivity Analysis Runner → Contract Term Evaluator → Negotiation Position Scorer → Report Generator
  - *Comprehensive Impact Assessment*: Multiple data extractors → Labor Cost Projector → Budget Impact Calculator → Risk Assessment Generator → Financial Constraint Validator → Dashboard Metrics Builder → Report Generator

  ## STEP 5 — Produce tools
