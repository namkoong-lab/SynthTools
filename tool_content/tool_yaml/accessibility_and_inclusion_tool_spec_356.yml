field_name: accessibility_and_inclusion
subfield: Physical Space and Architecture Accessibility
task: Conduct accessibility audits and assessments of existing buildings and facilities
tool_description: |-
  ## STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty

  This task is **hard** due to its comprehensive scope requiring expertise across multiple domains (architecture, disability studies, legal compliance), extensive coordination between technical assessments and stakeholder input, high risk of errors that could impact safety and legal compliance, and substantial data requirements including detailed building measurements, code standards, and user feedback analysis.

  ## STEP 2 — Set a tool budget

  Given the hard difficulty rating, I'm targeting **17 tools** within the 15-20 range to cover the comprehensive workflow from initial building documentation through final reporting and remediation planning.

  ## STEP 3 — List all tool names and dependencies

  **Tools and Dependencies:**
  1. **Building Data Collector** - Consumes: building location/ID → Produces: basic building information
  2. **Floor Plan Digitizer** - Consumes: physical drawings/images → Produces: digital floor plan data
  3. **Accessibility Measurement Tool** - Consumes: physical spaces → Produces: dimensional measurements
  4. **Code Compliance Checker** - Consumes: measurements, building type → Produces: compliance status
  5. **Barrier Identification Tool** - Consumes: floor plans, measurements → Produces: barrier catalog
  6. **Wayfinding Assessment Tool** - Consumes: signage data, layout → Produces: navigation analysis
  7. **Emergency Egress Analyzer** - Consumes: exit routes, capacity data → Produces: egress evaluation
  8. **Assistive Technology Compatibility** - Consumes: technology inventory → Produces: compatibility assessment
  9. **User Experience Surveyor** - Consumes: user feedback → Produces: experience metrics
  10. **Photo Documentation Tool** - Consumes: location data → Produces: visual evidence catalog
  11. **Cost Estimation Calculator** - Consumes: remediation items → Produces: budget estimates
  12. **Priority Assessment Matrix** - Consumes: violations, costs, impact → Produces: priority rankings
  13. **Legal Risk Analyzer** - Consumes: compliance gaps → Produces: legal risk assessment
  14. **Remediation Plan Generator** - Consumes: priorities, costs, timelines → Produces: action plans
  15. **Progress Tracking Dashboard** - Consumes: implementation data → Produces: progress reports
  16. **Stakeholder Report Builder** - Consumes: all assessment data → Produces: formatted reports
  17. **Audit Timeline Coordinator** - Consumes: task dependencies → Produces: project schedule

  ## STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans

  **Simple Plans:**
  - **Basic Compliance Check**: Building Data Collector → Accessibility Measurement Tool → Code Compliance Checker (quick regulatory assessment)
  - **Visual Documentation**: Photo Documentation Tool → Barrier Identification Tool → Stakeholder Report Builder (evidence-based reporting)

  **Medium Plans:**
  - **Comprehensive Assessment**: Building Data Collector → Floor Plan Digitizer → Accessibility Measurement Tool → Barrier Identification Tool → Code Compliance Checker → Priority Assessment Matrix (full facility evaluation)
  - **User-Centered Audit**: User Experience Surveyor → Wayfinding Assessment Tool → Assistive Technology Compatibility → Legal Risk Analyzer → Remediation Plan Generator (stakeholder-focused assessment)

  **Complex Plans:**
  - **Full Audit Lifecycle**: Audit Timeline Coordinator → Building Data Collector → Floor Plan Digitizer → Accessibility Measurement Tool → Emergency Egress Analyzer → Wayfinding Assessment Tool → User Experience Surveyor → Code Compliance Checker → Barrier Identification Tool → Legal Risk Analyzer → Cost Estimation Calculator → Priority Assessment Matrix → Remediation Plan Generator → Stakeholder Report Builder → Progress Tracking Dashboard (complete end-to-end audit)
  - **Multi-Phase Implementation**: All assessment tools → Priority Assessment Matrix → Cost Estimation Calculator → Remediation Plan Generator → Progress Tracking Dashboard → periodic re-auditing with subset of tools (ongoing accessibility improvement program)

  ## STEP 5 — Produce tools
