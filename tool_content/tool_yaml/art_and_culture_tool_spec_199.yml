subfield: Art Authentication and Provenance
task: Historical ownership research and chain of custody verification
tool_description: |-
  **STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty**

  This task is **hard** due to the extensive scope of historical research required, high ambiguity in incomplete records, complex dependencies between multiple verification sources, critical impact of authentication errors on artwork value, and substantial data infrastructure needs across museums, auction houses, legal databases, and historical archives.

  **STEP 2 — Set a tool budget**

  Given the hard difficulty rating, I'm targeting **17 tools** to cover the comprehensive workflows needed for historical ownership research and chain of custody verification.

  **STEP 3 — Tool dependencies and affordances**

  Tools consume: artwork identifiers, owner names, dates, auction records, museum data, legal documents, expert opinions, physical evidence, and verification criteria. Tools produce: ownership chains, authenticity assessments, provenance gaps, risk scores, documentation compilations, timeline reconstructions, comparative analyses, and verification reports.

  **STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans**

  **Simple plans:**
  1. Basic provenance check: Artwork Metadata Extractor → Ownership Chain Builder → Provenance Gap Detector
  2. Quick authentication: Physical Evidence Analyzer → Expert Opinion Aggregator → Authentication Report Generator

  **Medium plans:**
  1. Auction verification: Historical Auction Searcher → Sale Record Validator → Document Authenticity Checker → Timeline Reconstructor
  2. Museum verification: Museum Collection Checker → Exhibition History Tracer → Catalog Cross Referencer → Provenance Documentation Compiler

  **Complex plans:**
  1. Complete authentication: All metadata tools → ownership and timeline tools → validation and verification tools → risk assessment → final reporting
  2. Legal due diligence: Legal database tools → ownership verification → documentation compilation → expert consultation → comprehensive risk analysis

  **STEP 5 — Tools**
