  **STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty**

  This task is **hard** due to its high complexity across multiple dimensions: it involves intricate engineering workflows spanning design, simulation, manufacturing, and testing of critical safety systems; requires coordination between aerodynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, and control systems; carries extremely high risk where errors can result in catastrophic failures; and demands extensive data analysis, specialized infrastructure, and rigorous validation processes.

  **STEP 2 — Set a tool budget**

  Given the hard difficulty rating, I'm targeting **18 tools** within the 15–20 range to comprehensively cover the complex, multi-disciplinary workflows involved in propulsion system development and testing.

  **STEP 3 — List all tool names and dependencies**

  Tools and their data flow:
  - **Propellant Property Analyzer** → produces propellant characteristics
  - **Combustion Chamber Designer** → consumes propellant data, produces chamber specs
  - **Nozzle Geometry Calculator** → consumes chamber specs, produces nozzle design
  - **Thrust Performance Predictor** → consumes chamber/nozzle specs, produces performance metrics
  - **Injector Pattern Generator** → produces injector configurations
  - **Cooling System Designer** → consumes thermal data, produces cooling specs
  - **Thermal Analysis Tool** → consumes design specs, produces thermal profiles
  - **Pressure Loss Calculator** → consumes system specs, produces pressure data
  - **Vibration Analysis Tool** → consumes structural data, produces vibration profiles
  - **Ignition Sequence Planner** → produces startup procedures
  - **Test Facility Configurator** → produces test setup specifications
  - **Data Acquisition Planner** → produces sensor configurations
  - **Hot Fire Test Controller** → consumes test plans, produces test execution data
  - **Performance Data Analyzer** → consumes test data, produces analysis results
  - **Failure Mode Analyzer** → consumes system specs, produces risk assessments
  - **Regression Test Validator** → consumes historical data, produces validation results
  - **System Integration Checker** → consumes multiple component specs, produces integration analysis
  - **Certification Report Generator** → consumes all analysis data, produces compliance documentation

  **STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans**

  **Simple plans:**
  1. **Basic propellant analysis**: Propellant Property Analyzer → Combustion Chamber Designer → Thrust Performance Predictor
  2. **Nozzle optimization**: Nozzle Geometry Calculator → Thermal Analysis Tool → Performance Data Analyzer

  **Medium plans:**
  1. **Engine design iteration**: Propellant Property Analyzer → Combustion Chamber Designer → Injector Pattern Generator → Cooling System Designer → Thrust Performance Predictor → System Integration Checker
  2. **Test preparation workflow**: Test Facility Configurator → Data Acquisition Planner → Ignition Sequence Planner → Hot Fire Test Controller

  **Complex plans:**
  1. **Complete development cycle**: Propellant Property Analyzer → Combustion Chamber Designer → Nozzle Geometry Calculator → Injector Pattern Generator → Cooling System Designer → Thermal Analysis Tool → Pressure Loss Calculator → System Integration Checker → Failure Mode Analyzer → Certification Report Generator
  2. **Full testing campaign**: Test Facility Configurator → Data Acquisition Planner → Ignition Sequence Planner → Hot Fire Test Controller → Performance Data Analyzer → Vibration Analysis Tool → Regression Test Validator → Failure Mode Analyzer

  **STEP 5 — Produce tools**
