task: Assess water quality and test for contaminants and pathogens
tool_description: |-
  **STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty**

  This task is **hard** due to the complexity of identifying multiple types of contaminants (chemical, biological, physical), the critical safety implications of incorrect assessments, the need for coordinated multi-step testing procedures, and the requirement for specialized knowledge to interpret results and recommend appropriate treatment methods.

  **STEP 2 — Set a tool budget**

  Given the hard difficulty rating, I'm targeting **17 tools** to cover the comprehensive testing, analysis, and assessment workflows required for water quality evaluation.

  **STEP 3 — List all tool names and dependencies**

  Tools and their relationships:
  - **Water Sample Collector** → produces samples for testing tools
  - **pH Level Tester** → consumes samples, produces acidity data
  - **Turbidity Meter** → consumes samples, produces clarity measurements
  - **Chemical Contaminant Detector** → consumes samples, produces chemical analysis
  - **Bacterial Pathogen Tester** → consumes samples, produces bacterial counts
  - **Viral Pathogen Detector** → consumes samples, produces viral presence data
  - **Heavy Metal Analyzer** → consumes samples, produces metal concentration data
  - **Nitrate Nitrite Tester** → consumes samples, produces nitrogen compound levels
  - **Chlorine Residual Meter** → consumes samples, produces disinfectant levels
  - **Dissolved Oxygen Analyzer** → consumes samples, produces oxygen content
  - **Conductivity Tester** → consumes samples, produces electrical conductivity
  - **Water Quality Calculator** → consumes all test results, produces overall assessment
  - **Contaminant Risk Evaluator** → consumes test data, produces risk classifications
  - **Treatment Method Recommender** → consumes assessment data, produces treatment options
  - **Portable Test Kit Manager** → manages field testing equipment
  - **Water Source Profiler** → characterizes water sources and sampling conditions
  - **Quality Report Generator** → consumes all data, produces comprehensive reports

  **STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans**

  **Simple workflows:**
  1. Basic safety check: Water Sample Collector → pH Level Tester → Turbidity Meter → Water Quality Calculator
  2. Field assessment: Portable Test Kit Manager → Water Source Profiler → Chemical Contaminant Detector → Quality Report Generator

  **Medium workflows:**
  1. Comprehensive biological testing: Water Sample Collector → Bacterial Pathogen Tester → Viral Pathogen Detector → Contaminant Risk Evaluator → Treatment Method Recommender
  2. Chemical analysis suite: Chemical Contaminant Detector → Heavy Metal Analyzer → Nitrate Nitrite Tester → Chlorine Residual meter → Water Quality Calculator

  **Complex workflows:**
  1. Complete water assessment: All tools in sequence from sampling through final report generation
  2. Multi-source comparison: Water Source Profiler → (parallel testing with multiple detector tools) → Contaminant Risk Evaluator → Treatment Method Recommender → Quality Report Generator

  **STEP 5 — Produce tools**
