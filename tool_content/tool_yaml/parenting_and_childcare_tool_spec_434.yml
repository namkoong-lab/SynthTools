task: Age-appropriate learning activity discovery and recommendation
tool_description: "## STEP 1 — Rate task difficulty\n\nThis task has medium difficulty. It requires understanding child development stages, educational theories, safety considerations, and matching activities to individual needs. The scope involves multiple domains (cognitive, physical, social development), but the requirements are well-defined with established pedagogical frameworks to guide decisions.\n\n## STEP 2 — Set a tool budget\n\nGiven the medium difficulty, I'll target 12 tools to cover the various aspects of discovering, filtering, customizing, and recommending age-appropriate learning activities.\n\n## STEP 3 — List all tool names with dependencies and affordances\n\n**Tool Names & Flow:**\n1. **Child Profile Creator** → produces child characteristics for activity matching\n2. **Activity Database Search** → consumes age/interests, produces raw activity lists  \n3. **Development Stage Analyzer** → consumes child profile, produces developmental readiness\n4. **Safety Requirements Checker** → consumes activities + child info, produces safety assessments\n5. **Learning Objective Mapper** → consumes activities, produces educational outcomes\n6. **Resource Requirements Calculator** → consumes activities, produces material/time needs\n7. **Activity Difficulty Assessor** → consumes activities + child profile, produces complexity ratings\n8. **Seasonal Activity Filter** → consumes activities + timing, produces seasonally appropriate options\n9. **Activity Schedule Builder** → consumes multiple activities + constraints, produces structured plans\n10. **Progress Tracking Setup** → consumes activities + objectives, produces monitoring frameworks\n11. **Activity Recommendation Engine** → consumes all assessments, produces ranked suggestions\n12. **Custom Activity Generator** → consumes requirements + constraints, produces novel activity designs\n\n## STEP 4 — Multi-tool plans\n\n**Simple Plans:**\n- Quick recommendation: Child Profile Creator → Activity Database Search → Activity Recommendation Engine\n- Safety check: Activity Database Search → Safety Requirements Checker → filtered safe activities\n\n**Medium Plans:**  \n- Comprehensive search: Child Profile Creator → Development Stage Analyzer → Activity Database Search → Learning Objective Mapper → Activity Recommendation Engine\n- Seasonal planning: Child Profile Creator → Activity Database Search → Seasonal Activity Filter → Resource Requirements Calculator → Activity Schedule Builder\n\n**Complex Plans:**\n- Full discovery pipeline: Child Profile Creator → Development Stage Analyzer → Activity Database Search → Safety Requirements Checker → Learning Objective Mapper → Activity Difficulty Assessor → Resource Requirements Calculator → Activity Recommendation Engine → Progress Tracking Setup\n- Custom activity creation: Child Profile Creator → Development Stage Analyzer → Learning Objective Mapper → Custom Activity Generator → Safety Requirements Checker → Resource Requirements Calculator → Activity Schedule Builder\n\n## STEP 5 — Produce tools\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"Child Profile Creator\",\n  \"tool_description\": \"Creates a comprehensive profile of a child including age, developmental milestones, interests, learning preferences, and any special considerations for activity planning.\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"child_age_months\": {\n      \"type\": \"integer\",\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"description\": \"Child's age in months (6-216 months, i.e., 6 months to 18 years)\"\n    },\n    \"interests\": {\n      \"type\": \"array\",\n      \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"description\": \"Child's current interests and hobbies\",\n      \"minItems\": 1,\n      \"maxItems\": 10\n    },\n    \"learning_style\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"required\": false,\n      \"description\": \"Preferred learning style: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, or mixed\",\n      \"default\": \"mixed\"\n    },\n    \"special_needs\": {\n      \"type\": \"array\",\n      \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n      \"required\": false,\n\
