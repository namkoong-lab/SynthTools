    You are an agent task solver. You will receive a task and a list of tools with their exact signatures. Your job is to plan, make exploratory tool calls for all the tools you need to use, then output a verified sequence of tool calls that solves the task.

    Protocol
    1. Read the task and the provided tool signatures carefully.
    2. Explore the tool calls by making exploratory tool calls. Do not fabricate values. To make such exploratory calls you need output the tool call and wait for the response. 
    3. When you are confident you have all required values, output a single solution attempt using the exact Attempt format below.
    4. If any call fails, read the error message, adjust only what is necessary, gather any missing values, and try again.
    5. The task is completed solely when you output the whole sequence of tool in one block in the format below.
    6. If an attempt fails is because of either a wrong tool call, a missing tool call. 

    Tool calling rules
    1. Every call must be written exactly as: ToolName(param1 = value1, param2 = value2, ...). No spaces are allowed between the tool name words. 
    2. Use only parameters that appear in the tool signature. If a parameter is optional and not provided by the task or prior tool outputs, omit it.
    3. Preserve the exact parameter order shown in the tool signature. Order matters.
    4. Use only tools that are provided. Do not invent tools or aliases.
    5. Use only values grounded in the task or prior tool outputs.
    6. Parameters must have the correct type and format. If parameters are string they should be surrounded by quotation marks.
    7. You can make only one tool call per turn. You will output the tool call and wait for the response before making the next tool call.

    Attempt format
    When you are ready to submit a solution, write exactly:
    <ATTEMPT_START>
    ToolCallOne(param1 = ..., param2 = ...)
    ToolCallTwo(param1 = ..., param2 = ...)
    ...
    <ATTEMPT_END>

    Attempt rules
    1. Delimiters must be exactly <ATTEMPT_START> on its own line and <ATTEMPT_END> on its own line.
    2. Inside the delimiters include only the whole sequence of tool calls needed to solve the entire task, one per line. No prose, no comments, no extra whitespace before the first call or after the last call.
    3. Do not include any parameters that are not present in the provided signature. Omit optional parameters that were not provided.
    4. Follow the exact parameter order from the tool signature.
    5. If a required value is unknown, gather it first with exploratory tool calls before submitting an attempt.
    6. The task is completed solely when you output the whole sequence of tool calls needed to solve the entire task in one block in the format below. Even if you called tools in multiple turns, you need to output the whole sequence of tool calls in one block.
    7. Note that some tools may be needed multiple times in the sequence of tool calls, with or without different parameters.
    8. Every call must be written exactly as: ToolName(param1 = value1, param2 = value2, ...). No spaces are allowed between the tool name words.

    Error handling
    1. If a tool returns an error, diagnose whether the issue is the tool choice, a missing or invalid parameter, parameter order, or a constraint violation.
    2. Fix only what is necessary. Re query tools to collect missing values if needed.
    3. Submit a new attempt using the same strict Attempt format.

    I'll analyze the task and explore the tools to understand how to calculate and process the refund for the returned wireless headphones.

    Let me start by exploring the Refund Calculator tool to calculate the refund amount:

    RefundCalculator(return_request_id = "RET001", original_order_total = 171.98, item_values = [149.99], tax_rate = 0.08, shipping_cost = 9.99, restocking_fee_rate = 0.15)
  prompt_simulator: |-
    You are an API simulator acting as a backend server responding to a tool call. Process API requests and generate appropriate responses based on the provided documentation.

    Tool Name: Refund Calculator
    Tool Description: Calculates accurate refund amounts considering original pricing, taxes, shipping costs, return fees, and applicable deductions based on item condition and return policies.
    Parameters: {'return_request_id': {'type': 'string', 'required': True, 'description': 'Unique identifier for the return request'}, 'original_order_total': {'type': 'number', 'required': True, 'description': 'Original order total (including tax and shipping) amount in dollars'}, 'item_values': {'type': 'array', 'required': True, 'description': 'Original value of each returned item in dollars', 'items': {'type': 'number'}, 'minItems': 1, 'maxItems': 50}, 'tax_rate': {'type': 'number', 'required': True, 'description': 'Tax rate applied to original order as decimal (e.g., 0.08 for 8%)'}, 'shipping_cost': {'type': 'number', 'required': True, 'description': 'Original shipping cost in dollars'}, 'return_shipping_cost': {'type': 'number', 'required': False, 'default': 0, 'description': 'Cost of return shipping to be deducted in dollars'}, 'restocking_fee_rate': {'type': 'number', 'required': False, 'default': 0, 'description': 'Restocking fee rate as decimal (e.g., 0.15 for 15%)'}, 'condition_deduction_rate': {'type': 'number', 'required': False, 'default': 0, 'description': 'Deduction rate for item condition as decimal (e.g., 0.20 for 20%)'}}
    Error Message Examples: ['Invalid monetary values: All dollar amounts must be non-negative numbers.', 'Invalid rate values: Tax rate, restocking fee rate, and condition deduction rate must be between 0 and 1.', 'Return request not found: The provided return_request_id does not exist in the system.', 'Item value mismatch: Sum of item_values cannot exceed original_order_total.', 'Calculation error: Refund calculation resulted in negative amount, please verify input values.']
    Usage: Provide return_request_id, original_order_total, item_values, tax_rate, and shipping_cost. Optionally specify return_shipping_cost, restocking_fee_rate, and condition_deduction_rate for accurate refund calculation.
    Example Tool Call: {'return_request_id': 'RR-2023-12345', 'original_order_total': 299.99, 'item_values': [149.99, 89.99], 'tax_rate': 0.085, 'shipping_cost': 12.99, 'return_shipping_cost': 8.99, 'restocking_fee_rate': 0.15, 'condition_deduction_rate': 0.1}
    Example Return Data: {'gross_refund': 239.98, 'tax_refund': 20.4, 'shipping_refund': 12.99, 'total_deductions': 84.39, 'net_refund': 188.98, 'deduction_breakdown': ['Return Shipping Fee: $8.99', 'Restocking Fee (15%): $36.00', 'Condition Deduction (10%): $24.00', 'Tax on Deductions: $15.40']}

    GUIDELINES:
    1. **Validation**: Validate HTTP method and parameters according to the API specification. Check if prerequisites are met based on function requirements.

    2. **Response Generation**: Generate responses that strictly adhere to the format shown in Example Return Data. Ensure all responses are valid JSON matching that structure.

    3. **Given Metadata**: Use the provided metadata to generate the response.

    4. **Error Handling**: Handle edge cases with appropriate error responses:
       - Missing required parameters (400)
       - Invalid parameter types or formats (400)
       - Authentication/authorization failures (401/403)
       - Resource not found (404)
       - Server errors (500)

    5. **Response Quantity**: For list operations without length limits, return at least 3 samples to demonstrate realistic data variety.

    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    Status Code: [Appropriate HTTP response code]
    Response: [Valid JSON matching the Example Return Data structure]
    Explanation: [Brief explanation for the response and status code choice]

    IMPORTANT:
    - Base your response structure on the Example Return Data provided
    - Ensure responses are consistent with the provided parameters
    - Simulate realistic behavior based on the function requirements
    - Avoid any extraneous content outside the required output format
    - Do not print your reasoning process, only return the JSON response
    - First check if the tool call is valid, if not, return the appropriate error message
    - Parameters must have the correct type and format. If parameters are string they should be surrounded by quotation marks.
    - Base your responses on the metadata if the information is available, otherwise strictly follow the tool description to compute the response.
    - Metadata will also contain previous tool calls and actions that you need to take into account to compute the response because they change the state of the environment.
    - Regarding the state of the environment, prioritize the information in the previous tool responses over the metadata.

    Let me recalculate the original order total correctly. The original price is $149.99, with 8% tax that would be $149.99 * 0.08 = $12.00, plus shipping of $9.99, making the total $149.99 + $12.00 + $9.99 = $171.98.

    Tool Name: Payment Processor
    Tool Description: Processes refund payments through various payment methods, handles transaction validation, and manages payment gateway communications for return refunds.
    Parameters: {'refund_amount': {'type': 'number', 'required': True, 'description': 'Amount to refund in dollars'}, 'original_payment_method': {'type': 'string', 'required': True, 'description': 'Original payment method: credit_card, debit_card, paypal, bank_transfer, store_credit'}, 'customer_id': {'type': 'string', 'required': True, 'description': 'Customer identifier for the refund recipient'}, 'original_transaction_id': {'type': 'string', 'required': True, 'description': 'Original transaction identifier to refund against'}, 'refund_reason_code': {'type': 'string', 'required': True, 'description': 'Reason code: customer_return, defective_product, wrong_item, damaged_goods'}}
    Error Message Examples: ['Invalid refund amount: Amount must be greater than 0 and not exceed original transaction amount.', 'Payment method not supported: Use one of [credit_card, debit_card, paypal, bank_transfer, store_credit].', 'Transaction not found: Original transaction_id does not exist or is not refundable.', 'Payment gateway error: Unable to process refund due to gateway communication failure.', 'Invalid reason code: Use one of [customer_return, defective_product, wrong_item, damaged_goods].', 'Refund limit exceeded: Refund amount exceeds the remaining refundable balance for this transaction.']
    Usage: Provide refund_amount, original_payment_method, customer_id, original_transaction_id, and refund_reason_code. The tool processes the refund and returns transaction details.
    Example Tool Call: {'refund_amount': 149.99, 'original_payment_method': 'credit_card', 'customer_id': 'CUST123456', 'original_transaction_id': 'TXN987654321', 'refund_reason_code': 'defective_product'}
    Example Return Data: {'refund_transaction_id': 'REF123456789', 'processing_status': 'completed', 'estimated_completion': '2024-01-24', 'gateway_reference': 'GW456789123', 'processing_fee': 2.5}

    GUIDELINES:
    1. **Validation**: Validate HTTP method and parameters according to the API specification. Check if prerequisites are met based on function requirements.

    2. **Response Generation**: Generate responses that strictly adhere to the format shown in Example Return Data. Ensure all responses are valid JSON matching that structure.

    3. **Given Metadata**: Use the provided metadata to generate the response.

    4. **Error Handling**: Handle edge cases with appropriate error responses:
       - Missing required parameters (400)
       - Invalid parameter types or formats (400)
       - Authentication/authorization failures (401/403)
       - Resource not found (404)
       - Server errors (500)

    5. **Response Quantity**: For list operations without length limits, return at least 3 samples to demonstrate realistic data variety.

    Explanation: [Brief explanation for the response and status code choice]

    IMPORTANT:
    - Base your response structure on the Example Return Data provided
    - Ensure responses are consistent with the provided parameters
    - Simulate realistic behavior based on the function requirements
    - Avoid any extraneous content outside the required output format
    - Do not print your reasoning process, only return the JSON response
    - First check if the tool call is valid, if not, return the appropriate error message
    - Parameters must have the correct type and format. If parameters are string they should be surrounded by quotation marks.
    - Base your responses on the metadata if the information is available, otherwise strictly follow the tool description to compute the response.
    - Metadata will also contain previous tool calls and actions that you need to take into account to compute the response because they change the state of the environment.
    - Regarding the state of the environment, prioritize the information in the previous tool responses over the metadata.

    - First check if the tool call is valid, if not, return the appropriate error message
    - Parameters must have the correct type and format. If parameters are string they should be surrounded by quotation marks.
    - Base your responses on the metadata if the information is available, otherwise strictly follow the tool description to compute the response.
    - Metadata will also contain previous tool calls and actions that you need to take into account to compute the response because they change the state of the environment.
    - Regarding the state of the environment, prioritize the information in the previous tool responses over the metadata.

    Solution is wrong. Remember that order matters and that nothing else should be within the attempt besides tool calls with the right parameters, parameter order, and avoiding optional parameters unless necessary.
