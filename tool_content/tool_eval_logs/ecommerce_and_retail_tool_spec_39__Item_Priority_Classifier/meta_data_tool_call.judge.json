  "reasoning": "The tool call is fully correct with all required parameters present, correct types, valid ISO 8601 dates, non-negative item values, and matching array lengths. The simulator correctly returned PASS with status 200 and null error message. The return data contains all required keys from output_details with correct types: priority_classifications (array of strings), urgent_items (array of strings), standard_items (array of strings), and priority_score (number). The data is internally consistent - urgent items from priority_classifications match the urgent_items array, and the classifications appear reasonable based on delivery dates and customer tiers."
