  You will be given a Field name that represents a broad area of study or industry, a subfield within that field, and a specific task within that subfield.

  Come up with a tool that could be used to accomplish this task. Include the tool name, a description of what the tool does, and what is the schema of the expected parameters, what are the error messages that could be returned, and how to use the tool.

  Return the tool as a JSON object. For example:
  {{
    "tool_name": "Example Tool",
    "tool_description": "This tool does X, Y, and Z to help with the task.",
    "parameters": {{
